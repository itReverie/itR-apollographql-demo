This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The full tutorial can be found in: https://www.howtographql.com/

This repo has the following basics of GraphQL with ApolloClient and React. In the back end I used Graphcool.

- Queries [Loading links]
- Mutations [Creating links]
- Routing [Login, Create, List of links]
- Authentication [Login and Signup using the email-password template from Graphcool]
- More mutations and updating the store
- Filtering [searching in a list of links]
- Realtime updates [GraphQL Subscriptions (WebSocketLink)]
- Pagination [coming soon]
